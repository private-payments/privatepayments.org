As a rule of thumb, Private Payments fits any scenario where an XPUB might otherwise be shared or where sharing a static address creates a privacy risk.

## Donations

Instead of posting a static Bitcon address, a party wishing to receive donations posts a Private Payments code. A donating party can anonymously pay a payment code using a unique address. As long as the donator engages in coin control, there can be no loss of privacy by means of chain analysis for either sender or recipient.

## Payroll

An employer may decide to enroll an employee's payment code into their payroll system, thereby guaranteeing that every payout gets a unique address. This way the employee does not have to share his addresses either monthly or through an XPUB.

## Honor System Stand

The small-scale merchant who leaves goods for sale at an honor system stand could benefit from an alternative to posting a static Bitcoin address or running a server. A Private Payments code allows each customer to pay to a chain of unique addresses, thus enhancing privacy for the business.
